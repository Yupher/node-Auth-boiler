Hello,
this is nodeJS authentication boiler
I'm using three different authentication  methods (local, google Oauth, facebook Oauth)
**to test/use this code you need to**    

-**clone it**   

-**run npm install**      

-**register your app at google/facebook if you want to use google/facebook OAuth**      

-**don't forget to change ID's and Secrets with your own  and voila**        

**quick add : for facebbok for developper app activation you need a valid hosted privacy policy url I know it's kinda pain but you can do  it with free hosting services like netlify**
